# Privacy & Data Handling Policy

_Last updated: September 2025_

## Purpose
This project is a **demo application** to explore how NGOs might use AI for document digitization and translation.  
It is **not** a certified translation service, and it does **not** replace professional legal, medical, or immigration guidance.

## Data Processing

- **In-memory only (privacy app):**  
  Uploaded documents are processed entirely in system RAM.  
  No files are written to disk, unless the user explicitly downloads results.

- **No logging:**  
  Document text is not logged, stored, or transmitted in the privacy app.

- **Public demo (`doc_translator.py`):**  
  Uses online translation via Google (through `deep-translator`).  
  This means extracted text is sent to external APIs for translation.  
  ðŸ‘‰ **Do not upload sensitive or personal documents to the public demo.**

## Supported Languages

- **Offline translation (privacy app):** EN â†” FR, EN â†” SW
